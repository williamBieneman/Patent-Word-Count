# Patent-Word-Count

A project to find commonly used words in patent applications and grants within the US

To run PatentWordCount.py (the functional program in this repo) you'll need: ```requests```, ```bs4```, and ```json```.

Of these, all but bs4 should come installed with Python 3. If not, enter:
  ```pip install {package}```
into the command line.
